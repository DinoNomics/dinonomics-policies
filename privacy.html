Title: Privacy Policy – DinoNomics Auto Uploader

Effective Date: January 1, 2025

1. Overview

The DinoNomics Auto Uploader (“the App”) is a private automation tool created and used solely by Jerome “Jay” Jackson (“the Owner”) to upload his own DinoNomics educational videos to TikTok and other platforms.

The App is not offered to the public and does not create accounts for external users. This Privacy Policy explains what information is (and is not) collected when the App is used.

2. Personal Data Collected

The App is designed for the Owner’s personal use and does not intentionally collect or store personal data from public users.

Specifically:

No sign-ups, logins, or registrations are provided to the public.

No names, email addresses, phone numbers, or payment details are collected from public users.

The App only processes the Owner’s own video files, titles, captions, and related metadata for upload to TikTok.

3. Information Processed Automatically

When the App runs, it may temporarily process technical information necessary to perform uploads, such as:

File names and video content stored in the Owner’s connected storage (e.g., Google Drive)

Captions, titles, and descriptions generated by AI tools or entered by the Owner

API responses and identifiers from TikTok or other integrated services

This information is used only to automate content posting and is not sold or shared with third parties for advertising.

4. Third-Party Services

The App relies on third-party services, including but not limited to:

TikTok – for posting and managing videos

Google (e.g., Google Drive) – for file storage

OpenAI and similar AI providers – for caption/description generation

These services may collect and process data according to their own privacy policies. The Owner does not control how those third parties handle data. Users should review:

TikTok’s Privacy Policy

Google’s Privacy Policy

OpenAI’s Privacy Policy

5. Data Storage & Security

Because the App is a private tool:

Data is primarily stored within the third-party platforms mentioned above (e.g., TikTok, Google Drive).

The App itself does not operate as a separate database for public users.

Reasonable measures are taken by the Owner to keep credentials and API keys secure.

No system can guarantee perfect security, but the Owner uses industry-standard practices to reduce risk.

6. Data Sharing

The Owner does not sell, rent, or trade personal data.
Data is shared only as necessary with:

TikTok and other connected platforms to upload and display content

Service providers required for the technical operation of the App (e.g., API providers)

7. Children’s Privacy

DinoNomics videos are educational content suitable for children and families; however, the App itself:

Does not collect information directly from children

Does not provide accounts or interfaces aimed at children

Any data about viewers is handled exclusively by TikTok and other platforms according to their own policies.

8. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. The “Effective Date” at the top will be revised when changes occur. Continued use of the App signifies acceptance of the updated policy.
